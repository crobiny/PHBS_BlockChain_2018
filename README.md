## 1.Introduction


The operation of modern financial system can not be separated from the support of credit. Credit investigation, as a key link in the credit system, lays the foundation of financial credit risk management. With the advent of the era of big data and the rise of Internet finance, the problems of asymmetric credit information, limited data acquisition channels and weak data privacy protection in traditional credit reporting industry are becoming more and more serious.

Block chains, with distributed storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism and encryption algorithm, enhance the privacy protection of user data and build consensus trust at low cost, have broad prospects for development in the field of credit reporting.


## 2.Current Situation of Credit Reporting Industry in China

**China's credit reporting industry is dominated by enterprise credit reporting. Individual credit reporting needs to be developed, and the overall market prospects are broad.** China's enterprise credit reporting has developed earlier and the market is relatively mature. By the end of 2016, there are about 137 enterprises credit reporting institutions that have completed the filing in China. Personal credit investigation has not yet been marketized, and the licence has not yet been issued. Private individual credit reporting institutions can indirectly participate in the individual credit market through cooperation with banks and other financial institutions, but they can not directly issue individual credit reporting. To obtain individual credit reporting, they can only use the central bank credit reporting system. By the end of June 2016, the Central Bank Credit Inquiry Center had collected 21.2 million enterprises and other organizations and over 900 million natural persons, of which only 57.7 million and 410 million had credit records. Experian, a global credit magnate, has covered 103 million businesses and 89 million people worldwide. Comparing the market demand and credit market scale of the United States, there is a huge space for the future development of China's credit market.

**The integration of big data into traditional credit reporting is becoming a trend.** National policies encourage the application and development of big data in the credit industry. Big Data Credit Reporting has four innovative characteristics: wide coverage of groups, multiple information dimensions, rich solutions and comprehensive evaluation. Building a credit reporting system based on big data can improve the comprehensiveness, real-time and credit efficiency of credit evaluation. Private credit agencies, represented by Tencent Credit Inquiry and Sesame Credit Inquiry, rely on the massive data in the Internet field of Group Corporation to develop credit products. It has become an inevitable trend to integrate big data into traditional credit inquiry.



## 1.Introduction

Block chain is a distributed bookkeeping technology in P2P network. It is a supporting technology behind many cryptographic currencies such as BTC and ETC. Because the books in block chain can only be written by additions and shared by all nodes in the network, even the nodes that do not trust each other can easily verify the data and rely on a certain consensus mechanism to achieve consistency. Block chain technology can significantly reduce the cost of trust among multiple nodes, so it has a wide range of application scenarios and value in cross-border payment, voucher business, supply chain and some financial fields.

Because different nodes need to compute and verify the same data, data on block chains are required to be public. This increases data transparency and credibility, but also brings another problem-data privacy. In block chains, some nodes may not want their own transaction data to be public, including the identity of both sides of the transaction, transaction funds. Quantity, contract content and so on. This is not only important for customers who pay attention to personal privacy, but also for financial system and supply chain system, data privacy is one of the key points of their profits. Therefore, in order to make the block chain have a wider use space, we need to take into account the multi-node trust characteristics of the block chain and ensure data privacy.

In response to this demand, a lot of research work has been proposed in recent years: in the field of cryptography currency, Dash, Monero, ZCash and so on, they can solve the privacy problem of transaction data to a certain extent. The principles of privacy protection in the above studies are different. Some studies use a number of technologies to protect privacy, and the scenarios of block chains are different. We plan to summarize the privacy protection technologies of block chains.
